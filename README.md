## Disclosures & Acknowledgments

[Romario](www.github.com/bhgedigital) wraps the Python DSL from [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines), providing minimal functionality through key endpoints - mostly _kfp.client.run_pipeline()_ method. The opensource version of Romario is __NOT__ intended to be an exhaustive production ready service.  

The Pipelines team has been very supportive and we are very grateful.
